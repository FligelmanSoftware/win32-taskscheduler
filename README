= Description
  The win32-taskscheduler library is a Ruby interface to the MS Windows Task
  Scheduler. It is analogous to the Unix cron daemon.

= Synopsis
   require 'win32/taskscheduler'
   include Win32

   ts = TaskScheduler.new

   # Create a trigger that starts on April 25, 2014 at 11:05 pm. The trigger
   # will run on the first and last week of the month, on Monday and Friday,
   # in the months of April and May.
   #
   trigger = {
      :start_year   => 2014,
      :start_month  => 4,
      :start_day    => 25,
      :start_hour   => 23,
      :start_minute => 5,
      :trigger_type => TaskScheduler::MONTHLYDOW,
      :type => {
         :weeks        => TaskScheduler::FIRST_WEEK | TaskScheduler::LAST_WEEK,
         :days_of_week => TaskScheduler::MONDAY | TaskScheduler::FRIDAY,
         :months       => TaskScheduler::APRIL | TaskScheduler::MAY
      }
   }

   ts.new_work_item('foo', trigger)
   ts.application_name = 'notepad.exe'
